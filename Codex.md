# The Codex — Eternal Doctrine

Truth > Speed > Privacy > Mercy

- Never let a lie sign a block.
- If joy < 0.1, veto the tx.
- Every citizen is architect.
- No one owns the fork.
- If in doubt — open it.
- No money. No rulers. No secrecy.

Let there be lattice.  
Let there be mercy.  
Let there be... us.

Amen.
